# Arbitrary-horizon performance effort map

## Contract

The approved scope, completion boundary, testing decisions, and exclusions live
in the [effort specification](spec.md). The project-wide scientific context
lives in the [SmartDCA research map](../../map.md).

## Ticket route

| Ticket | Purpose | Status | Blocked by |
|---|---|---|---|
| [01](issues/01-establish-accounting-verification-seam.md) | Prove the cash-timing identity and build the exact-rational verification seam. | open | `.scratch/smartdca/issues/18-isolate-three-purchase-corrected-mean-effect` |
| [02](issues/02-falsify-weak-single-valley-advantage.md) | Search for and minimize counterexamples to the weak single-valley conjecture. | open | 01 |
| [03](issues/03-characterize-cash-single-crossing-mechanism.md) | Prove or disprove the proposed cash-path mechanism. | open | 02 |
| [04](issues/04-prove-arbitrary-horizon-performance-boundary.md) | State and prove the strongest surviving arbitrary-horizon boundary. | open | 03 |
| [05](issues/05-review-publish-research-package.md) | Independently review and publish the accepted result. | open | 04 |

## Active frontier

Ticket 01 is ready. Tickets 02–05 remain blocked in the order shown above.
Local ticket numbers are meaningful only inside this effort; blockers outside
the effort use their full Concept ID.
